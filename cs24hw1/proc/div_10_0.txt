With this set of inputs, our program will loop forever. This is because our loop changes
when we subtract our divisor from our divedend, and we wait for that value to become
less than 0 after repeating it many times. Since our divisor is 0, our value will never
change, and our program will continue executing because our "remainder" value
will always be 10 and never change. (This was stored in r7).
