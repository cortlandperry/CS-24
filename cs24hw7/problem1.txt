The program is intended to take results from both producers and then output
them with our consumer. What currently happens, which is the problem with our
current system, is that we only are printing values from producer 0. This is
because of the way we manage our threads. Because we "yield" our threads,
in bounded buffer add and take, we will produce two items in a row with our
producers, and then only consumer one item. As a result of this, the
consumer only takes one item off of the queue each time it is called, the
results from only one thread are outputted. This means that because we
are using cooperative thread execution, it causes us to never use the
results of one of the two producer threads, because their come one after
the other and we only call the producer once.
