Explicit Allocator Scenario:  Allocation Fails under Best-Fit but not First-Fit
===============================================================================
Our memory heap has 7KB, and we preform these operations on it:
1) A = allocate(3KB)
2) B = allocate(2KB)
3) free(A)

Now, our memory heap looks like this:
Free->3KB, B->2KB, Free-> 2KB

From this point, The steps we will take that cause best-fit to fail and
first-fit to pass will be:
1) C = allocate(1KB)
2) free(B)
3) D = allocate(6KB)

If we try to then allocate C, a size of 1KB, best-fit algorithm will place
C into the free block at the end of the memory heap. Our memory will then look
like so:

Free->3KB, B->2KB, C-> 1KB, Free-> 1KB

Now, we will free B, and our resulting memory heap looks like: (because of the
coalescing strategy that we have).
Free->5KB, C-> 1KB, Free-> 1KB

Now, when we try to add 6KB to this memory heap, best-fit will fail because
there are no available 6KB slots to free from.

Now, lets look at these same steps using first-fit. Using first fit, when we
allocate C, we add it into the first free block. This gives usa heap that looks
like:
C-> 1KB, Free->2KB, B->2KB, Free-> 2KB

Now, when we free B, we coalesce both free memory spots on the sides of B, with
the newly freed data from B, and thus we get:
C-> 1KB, Free-> 6KB

Now, we can clearly allocate 6KB into this memory heap succsessfully, and thus
best-fit fails while first-fit does not fail.
