Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?
To detect when a page is accessed, we will first, using mprotect() we will
set all of the permissions of our virtual memory to not allow any access.
This will mean when we first attempt to access any page, a seg fault
(access memory) will be thrown. Once this is attempted to access we will
then update a flag that will mark that the page is accessed, and change
the permission to the page to allow reads, and then we will read the page.
Thus, when we seg fault for the first time when it is tried to be accessed,
we will mark our page as accessed.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?
For us to tell when a page becomes dirty, we just have to determine whether
a page has been exclusively written too. Using the same method we had before
we can then only worry about if a write request. Thus, we will check if our
permission is read only when we seg fault, (because we can only seg fault there
if we are trying to write) and then we will update a  flag that will say
that our page has been written to, and we change the permission on the page
to write and read, similarly to how we checked it was accessed.

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:
53194 page loads were required

g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement:
FIFO policy

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000


Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 47944

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement: CLRU

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 6835

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.
