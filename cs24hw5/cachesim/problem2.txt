d) We ran on the command line:
./heaptest 32:256:1

There are blocks of size 32 bytes. We have 1 line per cache set, so each block
will be the cache set. Thus, we will have 256 total cache sets.

the cache miss rate was: 2.40%

e) We ran on the command line:
./heaptest 32:1:256

We know we only have 1 cache set in this case. Thus, the set must contain all
of the lines, which we know is the total size divided by the size of the blocks,
which is 256.

the cache miss rate was: 2.45%

g) running
./heaptest 32:256:1
the new cache miss rate was: 2.40%

running
./heaptest 32:1:256
the cache miss rate was: 2.26%
