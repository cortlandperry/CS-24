a) What miss rate are you seeing?

3 * 10^9 (cycles/sec) / 7.5 * 10^8 (inst/sec) = 4 (cycles/instruction)

4 (cycles/instruction) = h * 1 + (1 - h) * 100

h = .96969696
h is the hit rate.
m = (1 - h) = 3.03 percent

b)
3 * 10^9 (cycles/sec) / 15 * 10^8 (inst/sec) = 2 (cycles/instruction)

2 (cycles/instruction) = h * 1 + (1 - h) * 100
h = 98.99%

m = 1.01 %

We would need to reduce our miss rate by m1 - m2 = 3.03 - 1.01 which is
decrease miss rate by 2.02 %
